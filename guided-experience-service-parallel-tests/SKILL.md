description: "Use this when working in the guided-experience-service repository and the user wants to run all unit tests and integration tests in parallel. Prefer 2 parallel workers when subagents are explicitly authorized: one worker for the unit suite and one worker for the integration suite, each using 10 pytest workers. Run make install-splunk-app-deps immediately before the integration suite. After the parallel test runs complete, use repository-technical-analysis together with guided-experience-service-technical-analysis to review failures, suspicious errors, missing prerequisites, or likely root causes. Covers the repo-specific uv and pytest commands, when to prefer direct pytest over Makefile targets, optional Weaviate setup, and how to report results separately for unit and integration suites."

# Guided Experience Service Parallel Tests

Use this skill for broad test execution in `../guided-experience-service` when the goal is to run both the unit and integration suites in parallel. Prefer 2 parallel workers when subagents are available and explicitly authorized by the user, then review any failures or suspicious errors with `repository-technical-analysis` plus `guided-experience-service-technical-analysis`.

## First Read

- Read `../guided-experience-service/AGENTS.md` before running commands.
- Run commands from the repository root: `../guided-experience-service`.
- Use `uv` for Python commands and scripts.

## Workflow

1. Start in `../guided-experience-service`.
2. Ensure dependencies are installed with `uv sync` when needed.
3. If subagents are explicitly authorized, use 2 parallel workers:
   - Worker 1 owns unit test execution only.
   - Worker 2 owns integration test execution only.
4. Run the unit suite with 10 pytest workers:

```bash
uv run pytest -v -m "not integration and not functional" -n 10
```

5. Just before the integration suite, run:

```bash
make install-splunk-app-deps
```

6. Run the integration suite with 10 pytest workers:

```bash
uv run pytest -v -m "integration and not skip_ci" -n 10
```

7. Before running the integration suite, fail fast if `IAC_TOKEN` is not set.
8. Wait for both suites to finish.
9. If the integration suite depends on production Weaviate behavior, source `cicd/scripts/set_weaviate_config.sh` before running the relevant commands.
10. If failures suggest extra local infrastructure is needed, use the repo Makefile helpers such as `make test-db-start` and `make test-db-stop`.
11. After both suites finish, use `repository-technical-analysis` together with `guided-experience-service-technical-analysis` to review any failing tests, suspicious errors, environment gaps, or likely root causes.
12. Report the raw test outcomes first, then the follow-up technical analysis.

## Parallel Worker Template

When subagents are allowed, use a 2-worker split like this:

```text
Spawn 2 parallel worker agents with fork_context: true.

Worker 1:
- own unit test execution only
- run from ../guided-experience-service
- run: uv run pytest -v -m "not integration and not functional" -n 10
- return: summary, failing tests, and validation run

Worker 2:
- own integration test execution only
- run from ../guided-experience-service
- fail immediately with a clear error if IAC_TOKEN is unset
- run: make install-splunk-app-deps
- run: uv run pytest -v -m "integration and not skip_ci" -n 10
- source cicd/scripts/set_weaviate_config.sh first when needed
- return: summary, failing tests, and validation run

After both workers finish:
- use repository-technical-analysis plus guided-experience-service-technical-analysis to review failures or suspicious errors
- report raw test results separately from the follow-up analysis

Do not wait immediately after spawning. Wait after both workers have started or when results are needed.
```

## Command Selection Rules

- Prefer the direct `uv run pytest ... -n 10` commands above because the current `Makefile` test targets do not expose worker count.
- Prefer 2 parallel workers over a single sequential run when subagents are explicitly authorized.
- Prefer repo targets such as `make test-db-start` and `make test-db-stop` for database lifecycle instead of ad hoc docker commands.
- Run `make install-splunk-app-deps` immediately before the integration suite.
- For integration execution, check `IAC_TOKEN` first and stop with a clear error if it is missing.
- After the unit and integration runs complete, use `repository-technical-analysis` with `guided-experience-service-technical-analysis` to analyze failures, suspicious stack traces, environment problems, and likely root causes.
- Do not run functional tests unless the user asks for them; this skill is for unit and integration suites.

## Reporting

When summarizing results:

1. State the exact commands run.
2. Separate unit and integration outcomes.
3. List failing tests or modules clearly.
4. Call out missing environment or auth prerequisites explicitly.
5. Add a separate technical-analysis section that summarizes likely root causes, failure groupings, and next debugging steps.

## Useful Repo Anchors

- `../guided-experience-service/AGENTS.md` for repo workflow rules
- `../guided-experience-service/Makefile` for test and database helper targets
- `../guided-experience-service/pyproject.toml` for pytest markers and dev dependencies
- `../guided-experience-service/cicd/scripts/set_weaviate_config.sh` for production Weaviate settings
