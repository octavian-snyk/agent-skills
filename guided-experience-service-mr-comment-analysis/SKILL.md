# Guided Experience Service MR Comment Analysis

Use this skill from the `guided-experience-service` repository root when the user wants an MR analyzed comment-by-comment.
This skill consumes upstream GitLab MR context and grouped issue artifacts, then enriches them with guided-experience-service-specific technical analysis, verdicts, and proposed changes.

## First Read

- Read `AGENTS.md` before running commands.
- Read `gitlab` first to resolve normalized MR context, including MR identity, links, discussions, and thread status.
- Read `gitlab-mr-comment-analysis` next to convert that MR context into grouped actionable unresolved issues and reporting scaffolds.
- Use `repository-technical-analysis` together with `guided-experience-service-technical-analysis` for the actual technical analysis.
- After each technical analysis is complete, use `guided-experience-service-contributor` to add concrete proposed changes to the grouped-issue analysis file.
- Use `multi-spawn-agent` only when the user has explicitly authorized subagents or parallel agent work.

## Inputs

Accept, in order of preference:

- grouped issue context already prepared by `gitlab-mr-comment-analysis`
- MR context already resolved by `gitlab`
- or a raw MR IID / MR URL, which must first be resolved through `gitlab` and then grouped through `gitlab-mr-comment-analysis`

Prefer consuming existing upstream artifacts instead of repeating GitLab fetch or grouping work locally.

## Workflow

1. Start in the `guided-experience-service` repository root.
2. Check whether grouped issues are already available from `gitlab-mr-comment-analysis`.
3. If grouped issues are not available, check whether normalized MR context is already available from `gitlab`.
4. If only raw MR input is available, run the upstream `gitlab` → `gitlab-mr-comment-analysis` flow first.
5. Reuse upstream artifacts without recomputing them locally, including:
   - `mr_iid`
   - `mr_link`
   - project reference
   - direct comment links
   - actionable unresolved thread classification
   - reply status such as `answered_waiting_for_author_feedback`
   - stable grouped issue labels
   - grouped comment membership
   - analysis file paths
   - plan history and status tracking
6. For each grouped issue in `work_plan_mr_<MR>.md`, use `repository-technical-analysis` plus `guided-experience-service-technical-analysis` to inspect the relevant local code, tests, and nearby modules before concluding.
7. After the technical analysis is complete for a grouped issue, run `guided-experience-service-contributor` to add concrete proposed changes to the same analysis file.
8. If subagents are explicitly authorized, use `multi-spawn-agent` and spawn one worker per independent grouped issue or per small disjoint set of grouped issues.
9. If subagents are not authorized, analyze the grouped issues sequentially with the same file layout.
10. Enrich the upstream reporting artifacts with guided-experience-service-specific verdicts, repo-specific risks, prerequisites, blockers, and recommended next actions.
11. Finish with a concise on-screen report with 2-3 lines per analyzed grouped issue plus the path to its Markdown file.

## Worker Requirements

Each grouped-issue analysis must:

- identify whether the comment appears valid, partially valid, outdated, or blocked by missing context
- inspect the relevant local code, tests, and nearby modules before concluding
- note missing prerequisites, environment gaps, or follow-up checks when they materially affect the conclusion
- record whether you have already replied and are waiting for feedback from the comment author
- only cover grouped issues assigned in `work_plan_mr_<MR>.md`
- write one Markdown file per assigned grouped issue
- after the technical analysis section is complete, use `guided-experience-service-contributor` sequentially in the same worker to add a proposed changes section to the same file

Use this per-issue file shape:

```text
analysis_mr_<MR>_issue_<NN>.md
```

Each file should contain:

1. MR and issue label
2. MR link
3. direct MR comment links when available
4. reply status, including `answered_waiting_for_author_feedback` when applicable
5. grouped comment summary
6. affected files or modules
7. technical analysis
8. verdict
9. proposed changes
10. recommended next action
11. confidence and open questions

## Parallel Worker Template

When subagents are allowed, use a `work_plan_mr_<MR>.md`-driven split like this:

```text
Use gitlab-mr-comment-analysis, multi-spawn-agent, repository-technical-analysis, guided-experience-service-technical-analysis, and guided-experience-service-contributor.

Read work_plan_mr_<MR>.md first.

Spawn N parallel worker agents with fork_context: true, where N is based on the number of independent actionable unresolved grouped issues.

For each worker:
- read work_plan_mr_<MR>.md
- use repository-technical-analysis and guided-experience-service-technical-analysis
- after the technical analysis is complete, use guided-experience-service-contributor sequentially in the same worker to update the same analysis file with proposed changes
- own exactly the grouped issues assigned in `work_plan_mr_<MR>.md`
- create the assigned analysis_mr_<MR>_issue_<NN>.md files
- do not modify other workers' analysis files
- return: summary, files changed, and validation run

After all workers finish:
- refresh the final report using the upstream `gitlab-mr-comment-analysis` reporting scaffold
- show a screen summary with 2-3 lines per grouped issue and the corresponding Markdown path
```

## Boundaries

- Do not run raw Git commands here for repository identity; consume the `git` skill through the upstream `gitlab` flow when needed.
- Do not parse MR URLs directly here; consume normalized MR context from `gitlab`.
- Do not run `glab` or `glab api` here; GitLab transport belongs to `gitlab`.
- Do not resolve GitLab project identity here; reuse the project reference supplied upstream.
- Do not regroup raw comments here when grouped issues already exist from `gitlab-mr-comment-analysis`.
- Do not redefine stale-file cleanup or consolidated report scaffolding here; reuse the upstream `gitlab-mr-comment-analysis` workflow.
- Reuse upstream MR identity, project reference, MR links, direct comment links, thread classification, reply/waiting status, grouped issue labels, and analysis file paths.
- Do not ask the user for an MR IID or URL until after attempting the upstream `gitlab` resolution flow.
- If MR context is still missing after that flow, then ask for the missing MR IID or URL.

## Reporting

Follow and enrich the reporting structure produced by `gitlab-mr-comment-analysis`.
Make sure each per-issue analysis adds:

- a guided-experience-service-specific technical analysis
- a verdict grounded in local code and test inspection
- a proposed changes section produced with `guided-experience-service-contributor`
- any repo-specific prerequisites, environment gaps, blockers, or follow-up checks that materially affect the conclusion

## Useful Repo Anchors

- `AGENTS.md` for repo workflow rules
- `Makefile` for standard commands
- `pyproject.toml` for pytest markers and project config
- `cicd/scripts/set_weaviate_config.sh` when analysis depends on production Weaviate settings
